# DMCO Dodge-Attack Toggle Patch

## Description  
This patch adds a condition to dodge-to-attack transitions in the DMCO / Dodge MCO|DXP mod, preventing T-pose errors when dodge-attack animations are missing.

---

## Changes  
Gates Dodge attacks behind a boolean (currently defaulting to false), toggleable in MCM, so that players with MCO and BFCO movessets (basically all of them) without dodge attacks don't T-pose when attacking after a dodge. Alllows users to toggle this behavior on and off per weapon so that users with dodge attacks on specific weapon groups can still benefit from it without having to manually turn on the feature on and off each time they equip a new weapon.

---

## Installation

1. Install exactly as you would any mod, make sure it overwrites DMCO and DMCO dodge framework
