# DMCO Dodgeattack patches

## Description  
This patch adds a condition to dodge-to-attack transitions in the DMCO / Dodge MCO|DXP mod, preventing T-pose errors when dodge-attack animations are missing.

---

## Changes  
Gates Dodge attacks behind a boolean (currently defaulting to false), toggleable in MCM, so that players with MCO and BFCO movessets (basically all of them) without dodge attacks don't T-pose when attacking after a dodge.

---

## Installation

1. Install exactly as you would any mod, make sure it overwrites DMCO and DMCO dodge framework
